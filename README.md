# Vento's Poketool

A tool I made to check type matchups for individual and dual typings. Live version can be found [here](https://ventooreo.github.io/poketool).

# Usage

This site's most basic functionality is to server as a quick reference for Pokemon type matchups. <br>
Below the chart, there are additionally a Defense and Offense button<br>
While the Defense button is highlighted, licking on the type names on the chart or on the row below will allow you to view a specific type's weaknesses. <br>
Clicking on a second type will show you the weaknesses of that dual-type. <br>
While the Offense button is highlighted, clicking on type names will instead show Offensive matchups for that type <br>
Clicking on the types selected in either mode will remove them from the view. <br>
